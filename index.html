<h1>The Musik of The Maschine</h1>

<p>
Deep learning has revolutionised many fields, and music is no exception. MaschineMusik first got involved with deep learning as a way to automate the composition process. After experimenting with a number of different applications, he came across neural music composers in 2019. He was struck by how much more depth and complexity the resulting compositions had than anything he had come across previously.

<p>
Deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural networks have allowed computers to generate music in ways that were once thought impossible. MaschineMusik has been using these techniques to create unique and hauntingly beautiful compositions. 

<p>
MaschineMusikâ€™s work is not only a wonderful demonstration of the incredible power of deep learning, but also a fascinating glimpse into the future of music composition.
